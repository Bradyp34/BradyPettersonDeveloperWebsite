# BradyPettersonDeveloperWebsite

Welcome to my developer website! This is a project to showcase both my skills as a software developer working on the microsoft .net stack as well as an member of an agile team (and a good student, of course).

This is a Blazor web app that uses PostgreSQL and entity framework for my biggest tools. I'm also using the unit testing provided by xUnit in visual studio, thanks to its very easy integration, and I am using GitHub's workflows for CI.

Please enjoy exploring my website!
